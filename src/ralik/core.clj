A Parsing Expression Grammar parsing parser to parse PEG parser... parser?

Most parse operators return nil or false on failure and some arbitrary value
equal to boolean true on success. The exceptions are lex, kw, and g?.

Character-level parsers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These clojure literals can be used directly within a ralik operator.
\\x      - match a literal character
          (g+ \\x) => match one or more x's
\\uXXXX  - match a literal character given a unicode code point
          (g+ \\u0233) match one or more È³'s
\"foo\"   - match a literal string
#\"foo\"  - match a regular expression
          A PEG has syntax for character classes [A-Za-z]. This is the intent
          of this literal parser. It can be abused though. For instance:
          #\"(?s).+\" will match the entire input. One of the downsides to
          using complex regexps to match is there is no way to tell where the
          match failed.

Functional Parsers and Helpers, actually macros. The first group matches PEG's
standard operators (), +, *, ?, /, &, and !, respectively. / is reserved by
Clojure so | will do.

op     args        comment
---    ----------  -----------------------------------------------------------
g      & forms     match all parser arguments
g+     & forms     match one or more
g*     & forms     match zero or more
                   This parser always succeeds.
g?     & forms     match zero or one
                   This parser always succeeds but does backtrack.
g|     & forms     match the first parser that returns non-nil.
                   The parser backtracks before trying the next alternate
                   parser.
g&     & forms     fail if no match
                   The parser backtracks regardless of a match.
g!     & forms     fail if match
                   The parser backtracks regardless of a match.

       false-form  (g- \"bar\" \"foo\")

g_     form        match delimited text
       separator   For matching lists of items interspersed with a separator.
                   (g_ #\"[0-9]+\" \\,) will match: 1,32,753,0,23423423
g>     min         match [min, max] times
       max         Behaves as the suffix {n,m} in a regular expression except
       & forms     neither min nor max is optional.
kw     kword       match the given keyword and return the optional value
       & value
kws    & kwords    match one of the given keywords
lex    & forms     return the matched text
                   Return all of the text matched by the given parser(s) or
                   nil if no match.

-case  & forms     forms will be parsed with case sensitivity disabled
                  
Atomic parsers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These parsers were defined with def-atomic-parser. Their names are keys in the
map *atomic-parsers*. Their values are code that will be expanded in their
place during macro expansion.

wsp       match a single space, tab, newline, or cursor return
blank     match a single space or tab
eoi       match the end of the input
eol       match the end of a line
_         match a single character
          This will always match unless the current position is at *end-pos*.
          (g+ _) will match all input, one character at a time.

:kw-term  This is a special case. See: kw doc

Utility Functions or Macros
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Globals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These symbols must be bound in a binding form prior to calling any parsing
functions. They have no default values.

*text-to-parse*     bind to the input string
*cur-pos*           bind to the point in *text-to-parse* where parsing
                    should begin, generally 0
*end-pos*           bind to the length of the input string
*err-pos*           bind to 0
*err-msg*           bind to whatever you like, it will probably get
                    modified
*skipper*           bind to a function to perform skipping prior to matching a
                    character, string, or regular expression. Atomic parsers
                    should call this fn as needed.
*skip?*             bind to true to enable skipping, false to disable
*match-char-case?*  bind to false if \"FoO\" is to match \"foo\"
*char=*             bind to char= or char-case=

  "Return non-nil or value if the given keyword matches. The keyword must be an
 (unquoted) symbol, a string, or a clojure keyword. Its string name will be
used to match. The atomic parser :kw-term is used to define the code that
matches characters that cannot IMMEDIATELY follow the keyword. This is
generally the set of characters that define a valid keyword for your domain.

Example:
  Match the kw 'float' as defined by the language C:

Example:
  The keyword syntax is handy for matching false and returning a true value

The rules are defined as if they were functions in a letfn form with one
difference, the [argument vector is optional]. If the second form is a vector
it will be taken as the argument list. So if the rule returns a vector, but
takes no arguments, [] should precede the returned vector. At least one rule
is required.

  (rule1 [\"User needs to place an empty [] before this vector else it
          will be mistaken for the argument list and give a funky error\"])
  (rule1 [x y] (code-to-parse))		; this rule will pass through as is

The expanded function will return the result of the start rule on success, or
nil and, if :print-err? is true, print a simple parse error message on
failure.
